# Version 0.0.1
The current design for the project has two main entry points for the application. Of particular note is the `App` class which stores the `InputManger`, `ResourceManager` and `WorldManager`, all of which need to be easily accessible to each other and to their dependent resources. This is causing a a problem with scalability as each manager needs to inject themselves as a dependency to function and classes that don't actually require the manager, but need access to them to pass it to their children.

See ![updated design](0.0.2.MD) for refactored design.
